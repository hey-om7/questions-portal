# 🚀 MockTest GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Build and Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select **gh-pages** branch
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Access Your Site
Your application will be available at: `https://mocktest.fun`

## What's Already Configured

✅ **package.json** - Added homepage and deployment scripts for MockTest
✅ **gh-pages** - Installed as dev dependency
✅ **Quiz.js** - Updated fetch path for GitHub Pages
✅ **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that your repository is public
2. Ensure you have write permissions
3. Verify the repository name matches the homepage URL

### If questions don't load:
1. Check that `final-questions.json` is in `public/resource/`
2. Verify the file path in Quiz.js uses `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`

## File Structure for Deployment
```
public/
├── resource/
│   └── final-questions.json  ← Your question bank
├── index.html
└── ...
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the live site** - Make sure everything works
2. **Update README** - Add the live demo link
3. **Share the link** - Let others know about MockTest!
